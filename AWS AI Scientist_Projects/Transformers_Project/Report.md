## Project Report

## Project Summary
We built a transformer-based sentiment analysis model from scratch for IMDB movie reviews. The project involved tokenizing text data, implementing a custom PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader, and defining a DemoGPT transformer architecture customized for binary classification. The model was trained and evaluated to achieve robust performance in classifying positive and negative reviews.

## Key Takeaways
- Transformers can be adapted for text classification tasks.
- Custom Dataset and DataLoader simplify handling text data.
- Mean pooling helps aggregate token embeddings for classification.
- Proper evaluation and accuracy calculation are critical for model assessment.
